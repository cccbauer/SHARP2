# SHARP2

The Shanghai At Risk for Psychosis 2 (SHARP) study is a multi-site research effort to to assess early interventions for prevention of psychosis conversion. Clinical Hihgh Risk for psychosis subjects will be randomized to either receive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or Midfulness enhanced real-time Neurofeedback in order to help them normalize abnormal brain activity and connectivity. 


This repo contains scripts for:

* Running MURFI: [murfi-rt-PyProject](murfi-rt-PyProject)
* Running ball task for real-time feedback: [rt-PsychoPy](https://github.com/cccbauer/SHARP2/tree/main/rt-PsychoPy)

### Running a real-time Neurofeedback

Example Network-Based neurofeedback run [balltask](https://github.com/cccbauer/sharp2/tree/main/rt-Psychopy/balltask)

Example Network Based Experience Sampling: [experiencesampling](https://github.com/cccbauer/sharp2/tree/main/rt-Psychopy/experiencesampling)
